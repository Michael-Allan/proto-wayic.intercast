    biological analogues of intercast networking`
    - intercast networking viewed as a technique of recombinant text
        ( q.v. in projects textbender and Votorola

                        way  ∼  an individual of a way population
             way population  ∼  the ways of a waycaster network

                  wayscript  ∼  genetic code
                    waycast  ∼  the genotype of a way

                     waybit  ∼  a gene
             variant waybit  ∼  an allele
          waybit population  ∼  alleles at the same locus
          waybit population  ∼  locus
                   identity

    - here the biological analogy is expressed at a larger granularity than elsewhere
      in the documentation
        - which can be confusing
        - elsewhere the individual (implied) is the waybit
            - but here the individual is the way
            - while the waybits are only its genes
    - the analogy may be applied further depending on way context
        - this way, for example, would have analogues in the field of evolutionary ecology
            < http://reluk.ca/project/waycast/visionary/way.xht
        - analogues:
            * extinction avoidance
                - the endmost goal of "endless continuity" is analogous to *extinction avoidance*
            * demographic rescue
                - the overall means of securing that continuity
                  in the "existential refuge of great distances"
                  is analogous to the mechanism of *demographic rescue* by *dispersal*
            * evolutionary rescue
                - the underlying means of intercast networking *as a technique of recombinant text*
                  is analogous to the mechanism of *evolutionary rescue*
                - the demographic rescue
                    - being genetically encoded and evolved
                    - is thereby *also* a case of evolutionary rescue

    ____________________________________________________________________________________________________
    genetic content`
    - the part of a waybit's content that properly replicates across genetic links
        - e.g. in forming waybit variants, or in maintaining them by intracast text flow
        ( must be selective about this, as in Votorola difference bridging
    - all differences of declared waybit content exclusive of:
        - no start/end tag
            - as these declare linkage etc.
        - no referents (of links and such) external to the waybit
            - as not actually declared, potentially huge, redundant etc.
        - no uniquely personal lines of text
            ( http://reluk.ca/project/wayic/copy/doc.task
            - as not of interest to others

    ____________________________________________________________________________________________________
    genetic link`
    < a type of (§) intercast link
    - functions
        - declares a waybit to be a member of a waybit population
        - structures the waybit population by nominal lines of genetic descent
        - indicates approval of ancestral waybit content
            ( Votorola-style transitive vote flow ('delegate cascade') in a recombinant text
            - each genetic link is formally a vote
                - whereby the vote caster formally approves (votes for) the content of the parent
                  and (by transitive vote flow) that of the ancestors
            - here 'vote caster' means every waycaster for whom that link is on way
                ( http://reluk.ca/project/wayic/lex/way#on_way
                - why? to avoid pushing them into forming *direct* links merely to express approval
                  that is already implied by their use (on way) of the ancestors' descendant
    [ general to all forms
        * referring waybit
            - specified by all forms of genetic link
                - this is a waybit local to the declaring waycast

            - meaning
                - a nominal relation

                        - genetics as *actual* generative text flows and editorial influences
                    - rather declares a nominal relation of *intended* genetics
                        - to serve the practical (e.g. collaborative) purpose of the (§) waybit population
                - a genetic relation
                    - as opposed to a waypath parent-child relation

                - declares the source node to be:

                        - regardless of what population (if any) the target node itself belongs to
                    - potentially a genetic child of the target node
                        ( see § *link* attribute above

        § *variant* element
    - cycles
        - formally possible in lines of descent (*link* attributes)
            ( exactly as in Votorola
        - meaning of cycles will vary with the particular function of the link under consideration
        - effect will vary with the practical context, and may be blocked in some contexts

    waybit population`
    < a type of intercast network
    - a group of waybits interrelated by nominal lines of descent
    - purpose
        - competitive and collaborative way definition among waycasters
